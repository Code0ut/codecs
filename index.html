            Weekly Internship Report
Pune Vidyarthi Griha’s College of Engineering, Technology and Management
Name: Omkar Kalburgi		Roll No: 		Branch: T.E. Artificial Intelligence & Data Science
Internship Domain: Artificial Intelligence & Data Science    Organization Name: 
Week Number: Week 1		Reporting Mentor:

            Day-wise Work Details
Day 1: Introduction to Company Policies
On the first day of the internship, I was introduced to the company’s policies, rules, and regulations. The session covered organizational ethics, professional conduct, safety guidelines, confidentiality norms, and attendance requirements. This helped me understand the expected standards of behaviour and discipline within the organization.

Day 2: Introduction to Company Premises and Departments
The second day involved a guided tour of the company premises. I was introduced to various departments and their respective roles and responsibilities. This provided an overall understanding of the organizational structure and how different departments collaborate to achieve common objectives.

Day 3: Team Introduction and Interaction
On the third day, I met my internship team and was formally introduced to team members and mentors. The roles of each team member were explained, along with the workflow followed by the team. This interaction helped me understand teamwork, communication flow, and coordination within the organization.

Day 4: Introduction to Problem Statement (PS)
On the fourth day, I was introduced to the problem statement (PS) assigned for the internship. The basics of the problem were explained. This day helped me gain an initial understanding of the project and its expected outcomes.

Day 5: System Setup and Hardware/Software Configuration
The fifth day focused on setting up the required systems for internship work. Necessary hardware checks were performed, and essential software tools were installed and configured. This ensured that all technical requirements were met for smooth execution of tasks during the internship period.


Challenges Faced & Solutions
•	Initial difficulty in setting up hardware and software configuration
Solution: I was able to achieve desired hardware and software configuration by communicating with one of my seniors.
•	Unable to achieve an clear understanding of aim and objectives for the problem statement.

Student’s Reflection

This week helped me understand the working environment and professional behaviour followed in industries, along with gaining an overall understanding of how large-scale industries operate. The exposure provided valuable insight into industrial culture, coordination between departments, and structured work processes.
